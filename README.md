Game Project
-By John Patterson

This is a video game being built for the purpose of learning VR development in Unity. The other skills I'm learning through this are 3d modeling and animating in Blender.


Note:
I have since stopped working on this project. I spent a couple months going down the Blender rabbit hole and realized that wasn't what I wanted to be doing. I may come back to this at some point if I find models that I would be happy using so that I could focus on what was interesting.

Last demo showing animations and basic turn system:
